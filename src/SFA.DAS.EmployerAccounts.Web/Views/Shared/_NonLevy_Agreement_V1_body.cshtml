        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="1" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
        <h3 style="z-index:1">1.1</h3>
        <p>The ESFA is trialling a new way to engage training providers, for employers that do not pay the apprenticeship levy. It puts the employer firmly in control. You have been selected by us (“the ESFA”) to participate in the private beta testing. This will help us to test and shape a service that will eventually be rolled out for thousands of employers. We will refer to you in this Memorandum of Understanding as “Employer”.</p>
        <h3>1.2</h3>
        <p data-point="1.2">In order to ensure that the private beta testing goes smoothly, the ESFA has a number of requirements of Employers. The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to set them out and for you as an Employer to agree to comply with them.</p>
        <h3>1.3</h3>
        <p>This Memorandum of Understanding is not a contract but the expectation of the ESFA is that the Employer will comply with its terms.</p>
        <h3>1.4</h3>
        <p>This Memorandum of Understanding begins on 12 August 2019 or the date of the Employer's electronic acceptance of these terms and conditions on www.gov.uk (whichever is later) and ends on 31 December 2019 unless the ESFA communicates an extension to the Employer in writing.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="2" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">2.</span> Registration</h2>
        <h3>2.1</h3>
        <p>To participate in the private beta testing,the Employer must register for an account on the Apprenticeship Service (“Apprenticeship Service Account”).</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="3" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">3.</span> Reservation</h2>
        <h3>3.1</h3>
        <p>The Employer must create a reservation of funds for the apprenticeship. The reservation must created before apprentice details are added in the Apprenticeship Service Account.</p>
        <h3>3.2</h3>
        <p>Once registered, an Employer can authorise the training provider to create a reservation of funds on their behalf using the provider permissions functionality within their Apprenticeship Service Account. The Employer will receive a notification each time the training provider takes action on behalf of the Employer.</p>
        <h3>3.3</h3>
        <p>An Employer can revoke provider permissions at any time.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="4" style="position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: -1px; background-color:#fff"><span class="number">4.</span> Recruitment</h2>
        <h3>4.1</h3>
        <p>Training providers and Employers can both undertake apprenticeship recruitment through the Apprenticeship Service Account.</p>
        <h3>4.2</h3>

        <h3>4.3</h3>
        <p>The Employer will receive a notification each time the training provider takes action on behalf of the Employer. The permissions can be revoked at any time and therefore the Employer remains in control.</p>
