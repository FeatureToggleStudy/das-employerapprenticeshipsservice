        <p>Employers who pay the apprenticeship levy can transfer up to 10% of their previous year’s levy to other employers with an apprenticeship service account.</p>
        <p>Employers who want to transfer funds must first connect with a receiving employer through the apprenticeship service. Once a connection is made, a receiving employer can request transfer funds from a funding employer.</p>
        <p>Before getting started, make sure you understand the <a href="">rules for sending and receiving transfers</a>.</p>
